Pattern
1. Column Drop
   - At narrowest viewport, each element simply stacks vertically
   - As viewport gets wider, the first two elements are side by side (At first breakpoint)
2. Mostly Fluid
   - At narrowest viewport, each element simply stacks vertically
   - As the layout gets wider, the grid pattern starts to appear
   - Once layout hits its widest viewport, margins are added to the left and right, instead of expanding things out
3. Layout Shifter
   - Probably the most responsive pattern with multiple breakpoints across several different screen widths
   - The key to this layout is the way that content moves about, instead of reflowing and dropping below other columns
4. Off Canvas
   - Places less frequently used content like navigation, app-menus off screen
   - only if the screen is large enough then the nav/app-menu is shown
   - on smaller screens the app is typically shown when the user clicks on the hamburger icon
